# SupplyRun
A work in progress android app designed to allow users to request favors from their friends and submit instant person to person payment.

This application file contains all but two files from the project code.  Parse is used as the backend service, and the Parse application 
file containing initialization info as well as the string file containing all relevant API keys have been ommitted.  

NavigationActivity.java is the launcher activity with RunFragment.java being the first loaded fragment.

These files can be found along the path
SupplyRun/app/src/main/java/com/example/ggould/supplyrun/navDrawerFragments/

I apoligize for the lack of comments, I usually save those for the end since I frequently rework activity oprations and it all makes 
sense in my head.
